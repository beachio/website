						What Does a Beach Apprenticeship Cost?
					</p>
				
					<p>
						It is my goal that a Beach Apprenticeship will cost successful graduates nothing. That is, by the end of the 12 month programme, the cost of the education for one apprentice is completely covered and absorbed by the programme.

						Where is it based?
					</p>
				
					<p>
						The Beach Apprenticeship programme is for the modern age. As such, it is not restricted to any particular location or cubicle. A massive part of what you learn is the maturity to decide the best ways for you to be most productive in learning and building. Knowing when to collaborate, when to focus. We make that process easy, by partnering with the newest co-working spaces in Dorset to provide FREE access for our Apprentices. We come together regularly for team sessions, mentoring, office hours, presentations, code reviews.
