						Are you taking on new projects?
					</p>
				
					<p>
						We are very selective about the projects we take on, that's a lesson we've learned the hard way over the years. But we are always interested to hear from people with big ideas that can have a big impact on the way people live their lives, so for you, we're all ears...

						How do you work?
					</p>
				
					<p>
						We work together, very collaboratively and most importantly, we work closely with your customers. Over the years, we've developed a process for building products that draws on philosophies and practices of agile development, lean startup and lean UX. We belive that experimentation and rapid iteration of ideas is critical to success and avoiding waste of time and money.
